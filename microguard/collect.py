"""Durable archive of scored decisions, for building a real training set.

Stdlib only, and deliberately outside `live/`: `live/__init__.py` raises
ImportError without redis-py, and nothing here needs Redis. Same split as
`events.py` vs `live/redis_events.py`.

Why this exists. `mg:v1:events` is a ring buffer -- `events.py` caps it at
DEFAULT_CAPACITY and `live/redis_events.py` LTRIMs to it -- so it holds the
most recent 1000 decisions and drops the rest without saying so. That is right
for a dashboard and wrong for collecting data, which is the one thing this
project actually needs: there is no real human ground truth in the repo by any
route, and observe-only live traffic is the only source of it.

What a collected row is NOT: a labeled example. It records what the tool
guessed. Treating that as ground truth would train the model to reproduce
`labeler.py`, and `scoring.compute_combined_score` blends model and heuristic
-- so one signal would be counted twice while reading as two. Labels come from
`training.online_update.record_correction`, after a human looked.
