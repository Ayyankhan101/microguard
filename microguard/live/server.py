"""nginx auth_request microservice — standalone HTTP server.

Handles /check requests from nginx auth_request module.
Returns 200 (allow) or 403 (block) based on live scoring.

nginx config example:
    location /api/ {
        auth_request /_microguard_check;
        auth_request_set $microguard_label $upstream_http_x_microguard_label;
        proxy_set_header X-Microguard-Label $microguard_label;
        proxy_pass http://backend;
    }

    location = /_microguard_check {
        internal;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8400/check;
        proxy_pass_request_body off;
        proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
        proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
        proxy_set_header X-Original-Method $request_method;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header User-Agent $http_user_agent;
        # Drop any client-supplied X-Forwarded-For. Microguard keys sessions
        # on this IP, so a spoofable value means a bot gets a fresh session
        # per request and never accumulates a detectable history.
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For "";
