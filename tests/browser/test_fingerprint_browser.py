"""The fingerprint script, in a real browser.

Decision 9A. Everything asserted here is unfalsifiable without one: canvas and
WebGL do not exist under Node, and they are where the actual signal comes from.
A unit test of the hashing would pass with every probe returning a constant.

Two claims are checked here and nowhere else:

  1. The hash varies with the environment. A fingerprint that is identical
     everywhere is a constant wearing a fingerprint's name, and nothing else in
     the suite can tell the difference.
  2. Only the hash leaves the page. That is a claim the README makes, and
     asserting it in prose is not evidence -- this reads the real request body.

The page and the script are served from one routed origin rather than from a
running check server. The endpoint in the script is relative, which is correct
in production and unresolvable from `about:blank`; routing a real origin is
what makes the relative path behave the way it does on a real site. The server
side of /fp is covered against a real process in tests/live/.

Skipped when Playwright or its browser is absent, matching how this project
already handles its network-dependent tests. CI installs both.
