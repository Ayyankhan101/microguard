"""The collection sink is the only durable record of a scored decision.

`mg:v1:events` is a ring buffer -- `events.py` caps it at DEFAULT_CAPACITY and
`redis_events.py` LTRIMs to it -- so it holds the most recent 1000 decisions
and silently discards the rest. That is the right shape for a dashboard and
the wrong shape for building a training set, which is the one thing this
project actually needs: there is no real human ground truth anywhere in the
repo, and live traffic is the only source of it.

Two properties matter more than anything else here. The rows must survive a
power cut, because there is no second copy. And a failure to write one must
never reach the visitor: this runs under nginx `auth_request`, where a raised
exception becomes a 500 on someone's page load.
